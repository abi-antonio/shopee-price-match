# Introduction
This repository contains my submission to the Shopee - Price Match Guarantee Kaggle Challenge.

Three approaches were taken in predicting which product postings matches
1. Matching based on product title
2. Matching based on image phash
3. Matching based on product images


# Matching based on product title

For this approach, I used sklearn's TfidfVectorizer to convert the titles into vectors then used cosine similarity to determine which titles match

# Matching based on image phash

TBD

# Matching based on product images

TBD
